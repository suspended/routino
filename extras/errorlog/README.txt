                              ====================

This Perl script can be used to process the log file generated by runing
'planetsplitter --errorlog' and generate a summary of the most common types of
errors.

Example usage:

          Generate a summary of the number of each type of error that appear in
          the error log file as plain text.

          Generate a verbose version of the plain text summary of errors with
          each error item (node, way or relation) listed.


summarise-log.pl -html < error.log

          Generate an HTML file with a summary of the number of errors of each
          type with links to each of the items (node, way or relation) on the
          OSM website.
