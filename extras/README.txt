                                 ROUTINO EXTRAS
                                 ==============

This directory contains some programs and scripts that although distributed with
Routino are not necessary components of a working OSM router.  They are
generally either programs that use some components of Routino (i.e. they are
compiled and linked with some of the Routino source code) or they are scripts to
be used to process the outputs of Routino.

Each program or script has its own directory which contains all of the necessary
source code, documentation and/or web pages for that program or script.  None of
them will be installed when Routino is installed.
