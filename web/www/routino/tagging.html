<h2><a name="Tags"></a>Tags</h2>

The different tags that are used by the router software are described below.

<h3><a name="Nodes"></a>Node Tags</h3>

The only node tags that are used are the <em>id</em>, <em>latitude</em> and
<em>longitude</em> of the node.  The id tag is required to associate the node
with the ways and the position tags are not tags in the normal sense.

<h3><a name="Ways"></a>Way Tags</h3>

The tags from the ways in the data are the ones that provide most of the
information.  The <em>id</em> tag is used only so that the segments can be
associated with a way.

<h4><a name="highway"></a>The highway Tag</h4>

The most important tag that is used from a way is the <em>highway</em> tag.
This defines the type of highway that the way represents.  Any way that does not
have a highway tag is discarded.

<p>

There are more highway types defined than are used by the router.  The subset
that the router uses are:

<ul>
  <li>Motorway
  <li>Trunk
  <li>Primary
  <li>Secondary
  <li>tertiary
  <li>unclassified
  <li>residential
  <li>service
  <li>track
  <li>path
  <li>bridleway
  <li>cycleway
  <li>footway
</ul>

<p>
The other highway types are assumed to be equivalent to one of the types listed
above according to the table below.
<p>

<table class="center">
  <caption>Aliasing of equivalent highway types</caption>
  <tr>
    <th class="left">Highway type
    <th class="left">Equivalent type
  <tr>
    <td class="left">byway
    <td class="left">track
  <tr>
    <td class="left">living_street
    <td class="left">residential
  <tr>
    <td class="left">minor
    <td class="left">unclassified
  <tr>
    <td class="left">pedestrian
    <td class="left">footway
  <tr>
    <td class="left">road
    <td class="left">unclassified
  <tr>
    <td class="left">services
    <td class="left">service
  <tr>
    <td class="left">steps
    <td class="left">footway
  <tr>
    <td class="left">unsurfaced
    <td class="left">track
  <tr>
    <td class="left">unpaved
    <td class="left">track
  <tr>
    <td class="left">walkway
    <td class="left">footway
</table>

<p>
The second important thing that can be taken from the highway tag is the type of
tansport that is allowed to use the highway.  The list can be modified depending
on other tags, but the default assumptions are as shown in the table below.

<p>

The type of highway and the method of transport chosen for routing together
define a default maximum speed limit.

<p>

One additional assumption is that a motorway implies that the highway is also
oneway.

<h4><a name="access"></a>The access Tag</h4>

The <em>access</em> tag is used to specify the default access restrictions on
the way.

<p>

If the access tag is set to one of the values <em>true</em>, <em>yes</em>,
<em>1</em>, <em>permissive</em> or <em>designated</em> then the normal access
permissions above apply.  If the access tag is set to any other value then the
default setting for the way is set to no types of transport.

<p>

In addition to the access tag there is also one tag for each of the different
modes of transport: <em>foot</em>, <em>bicycle</em>, <em>horse</em>,
<em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>, <em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em> and
<em>psv</em>.  If one of these tags is present and the value is set to one of
true, yes, 1, permissive or designated then that particular transport type is
allowed (even if the generic access tag says that it is not).  If the tag is
present but not one of the values above then it is assumed that the particular
form of transport is forbidden.

<p>

For example a highway that has the tags: <tt>highway=service, service=driveway,
access=private, foot=designated</tt> is a private driveway that has a public
footpath running along it (not uncommon in the UK).


<h4><a name="name"></a>The name Tag</h4>

The <em>name</em> tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
the results.

<h4><a name="ref"></a>The ref Tag</h4>

The <em>ref</em> tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
the results.

<h4><a name="junction"></a>The junction Tag</h4>

The <em>junction</em> tag is used only to check if a highway is (part of) a
roundabout.  This tag is used for information to label the highway if no other
name is provided.

<p>

In addition to providing the label for the highway the presence of the
junction=roundabout tag also implies the highway is oneway.

<h4><a name="oneway"></a>The oneway Tag</h4>

The <em>oneway</em> tag is used to specify that traffic is only allowed to
travel in one direction.  When tagging it is important to make sure that the
direction that traffic is allowed follows the order of the nodes in the way.

<h4><a name="maxspeed"></a>The maxspeed Tag</h4>

The <em>maxspeed</em> tag is used to specify the maximum speed limit on the
highway; this is always measured in km/hr in OpenStreetMap data.  If the tag
value contains "mph" or the tag name is actually <em>maxspeed:mph</em> then it
is assumed to be a value in those units and converted to km/hr.

<h4><a name="maxweight"></a>The maxweight Tag</h4>

The <em>maxweight</em> tag is used to specify the maximum weight of any traffic
on the way.  In other words this must be set to the heaviest weight allowed on
the way (for example a bridge) in tonnes.

<h4><a name="maxheight"></a>The maxheight Tag</h4>

The <em>maxheight</em> tag is used to specify the maximum height of any traffic
on the way.  In other words this must be set to the lowest height of anything
above the way (like a bridge) in metres.  If the tag value contains a
measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are made to convert this to
metres.

<h4><a name="maxwidth"></a>The maxwidth Tag</h4>

The <em>maxwidth</em> tag is used to specify the maximum width of any traffic on
the way.  This must be set to the minimum width of the contraints at the wayside
in metres.  If the tag value contains a measurement in feet or feet and inches
then attempts are made to convert this to metres.

<h4><a name="maxlength"></a>The maxlength Tag</h4>

The <em>maxlength</em> tag is used to specify the maximum length of any traffic
on the way (usually from a traffic sign) in metres.  If the tag value contains a
measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are made to convert this to
metres.

<h3><a name="Relations"></a>Relation Tags</h3>

Currently no relation tags are used.
