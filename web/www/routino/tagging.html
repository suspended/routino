<h2><a name="Tags"></a>Tags</h2>

The different tags that are used by the router software are described below.

<h3><a name="Nodes"></a>Node Tags</h3>

The only node tags that are used are the <em>id</em>, <em>latitude</em> and
<em>longitude</em> of the node.  The id tag is required to associate the node
with the ways and the position tags are not tags in the normal sense.

<h3><a name="Ways"></a>Way Tags</h3>

The tags from the ways in the data are the ones that provide most of the
information.  The <em>id</em> tag is used only so that the segments can be
associated with a way.

<h4><a name="highway"></a>The highway Tag</h4>

The most important tag that is used from a way is the <em>highway</em> tag.
This defines the type of highway that the way represents.  Any way that does not
have a highway tag is discarded.

<p>

There are more highway types defined than are used by the router.  The subset
that the router uses are:

<ul>
  <li>motorway
  <li>trunk
  <li>primary
  <li>secondary
  <li>tertiary
  <li>unclassified
  <li>residential
  <li>service
  <li>track
  <li>cycleway
  <li>path (1)
  <li>steps (2)
</ul>

<p>

<i>
  Note 1: This has changed in version 1.3 of Routino - the bridleway and footway
  types have been included within the path highway type.  This change is to
  reduce confusion over multiple highway types that are likely to be physically
  indistinguishable.
  <br>
  Note 2: This has changed in version 1.3 of Routino - the steps type has been
  separated from the footway type.
</i>

<p>

The other highway types are assumed to be equivalent to one of the types listed
above according to the table below.

<h4><a name="access"></a>The access Tag</h4>

The <em>access</em> tag is used to specify the default access restrictions on
the way.

<p>

If the access tag is set to one of the values <em>true</em>, <em>yes</em>,
<em>1</em>, <em>permissive</em>, <em>designated</em> or <em>destination</em>
then the normal default access permissions apply.  If the access tag is set to
any other value then the default setting for the way is set to no types of
transport.

<p>

The default value of the access permissions depend on the type of highway.  The
default assumptions are as shown in the table below.

<i>
  Note 1: A path allows bicycle or horse access by default only if actually labelled
  as a "bridleway".
  <br>
  Note 2: A wheelchair is allowed anywhere that foot access is allowed unless
  the wheelchair is explicity disallowed.
</i>

<p>

In addition to the access tag there is also one tag for each of the different
modes of transport: <em>foot</em>, <em>horse</em>, <em>bicycle</em>,
<em>wheelchair</em>, <em>moped</em>, <em>motorbike</em>, <em>motorcar</em>,
<em>goods</em>, <em>hgv</em> and <em>psv</em>.  If one of these tags is present
and the value is set to one of <em>true</em>, <em>yes</em>, <em>1</em>,
<em>permissive</em>, <em>designated</em> or <em>destination</em> then that
particular transport type is allowed (even if the generic access tag says that
it is not).  If the tag is present but not one of the values above then it is
assumed that the particular form of transport is forbidden.  A tag named
<em>vehicle</em> means any of the above transport types that have wheels
(except <em>wheelchair</em>) and <em>motor_vehicle</em> is any vehicle except
a <em>bicycle</em>.

<p>

For example a highway that has the tags: <tt>highway=service, service=driveway,
access=private, foot=designated</tt> is a private driveway that has a public
footpath running along it (not uncommon in the UK).


<h4><a name="bridge"></a>The bridge Tag</h4>

The <em>bridge</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is a bridge and
therefore set one of the available properties.


<h4><a name="designation"></a>The designation Tag</h4>

The <em>designation</em> tag is used as an alternative method of identifying the
legal right of way on a path.  The values recognised are <em>bridleway</em>,
<em>byway</em> and <em>footpath</em> which equate to the following permissions:

<p>

<table>
  <caption>Aliasing of designation types</caption>
  <tr>
    <th class="left">Designation tag
    <th class="left">Equivalent access permissions
  <tr>
    <td class="left">bridleway
    <td class="left">foot=designated, horse=designated, bicycle=designated
  <tr>
    <td class="left">byway
    <td class="left">foot=designated, horse=designated, bicycle=designated
  <tr>
    <td class="left">footpath
    <td class="left">foot=designated
</table>


<h4><a name="name"></a>The name Tag</h4>

The <em>name</em> tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
the results.


<h4><a name="ref"></a>The ref Tag</h4>

The <em>ref</em> tag is used to provide the label for the highway when printing
the results.


<h4><a name="junction"></a>The junction Tag</h4>

The <em>junction</em> tag is used to check if a highway is (part of) a
roundabout.  This tag is used for information to label the highway if no other
name is provided.

<p>

In addition to providing the label for the highway the presence of the
junction=roundabout tag also implies the highway is oneway.


<h4><a name="lanes"></a>The lanes Tag</h4>

The <em>lanes</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway has multiple lanes
for traffic or not (the number of lanes is not important in this case, only
whether it is more than one) this sets one of the highway properties.

<p>
In the absence of a lanes tag only the <em>motorway</em> highway type is assumed
to have multiple lanes.


<h4><a name="surface"></a>The surface Tag</h4>

The <em>surface</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is paved or not,
this is one of the available highway properties.

<p>
In the absence of a surface tag the following highway types are assumed to be
paved: <em>motorway</em>, <em>trunk</em>, <em>primary</em>, <em>secondary</em>,
<em>tertiary</em>, <em>unclassified</em>, <em>residential</em>, <em>service</em>
or <em>cycleway</em>.

<p>
If there is a surface tag then the highway is assumed to be unpaved unless the
tag value matches one of the following: <em>paved</em>, <em>asphalt</em>
or <em>concrete</em>.

<p>
Support for the obsolete <em>paved</em> tag is also provided and the highway is
paved if this is set to one of <em>true</em>, <em>yes</em> or <em>1</em>.


<h4><a name="oneway"></a>The oneway Tag</h4>

The <em>oneway</em> tag is used to specify that traffic is only allowed to
travel in one direction.  When tagging it is important to make sure that the
direction that traffic is allowed follows the order of the nodes in the way.

<p>
One additional assumption is that if a highway is a motorway then it implies
that the highway is also oneway.


<h4><a name="maxspeed"></a>The maxspeed Tag</h4>

The <em>maxspeed</em> tag is used to specify the maximum speed limit on the
highway; this is always measured in km/hr in OpenStreetMap data.  If the tag
value contains "mph" or the tag name is actually <em>maxspeed:mph</em> then it
is assumed to be a value in those units and converted to km/hr.


<h4><a name="maxweight"></a>The maxweight Tag</h4>

The <em>maxweight</em> tag is used to specify the maximum weight of any traffic
on the way.  In other words this must be set to the heaviest weight allowed on
the way (for example a bridge) in tonnes.


<h4><a name="maxheight"></a>The maxheight Tag</h4>

The <em>maxheight</em> tag is used to specify the maximum height of any traffic
on the way.  In other words this must be set to the lowest height of anything
above the way (like a bridge) in metres.  If the tag value contains a
measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are made to convert this to
metres.


<h4><a name="maxwidth"></a>The maxwidth Tag</h4>

The <em>maxwidth</em> tag is used to specify the maximum width of any traffic on
the way.  This must be set to the minimum width of the contraints at the wayside
in metres.  If the tag value contains a measurement in feet or feet and inches
then attempts are made to convert this to metres.


<h4><a name="maxlength"></a>The maxlength Tag</h4>

The <em>maxlength</em> tag is used to specify the maximum length of any traffic
on the way (usually from a traffic sign) in metres.  If the tag value contains a
measurement in feet or feet and inches then attempts are made to convert this to
metres.


<h4><a name="tunnel"></a>The tunnel Tag</h4>

The <em>tunnel</em> tag is used to identify whether a highway is a tunnel and
therefore set one of the available properties.


<h3><a name="Relations"></a>Relation Tags</h3>

Currently no relation tags are used.
