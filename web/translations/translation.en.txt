$$ROUTER-INFO$$
This web page allows routing within the data collected by OpenStreetMap.
Select start and end points (click on the marker icons below), select routing preferences then find a route.
$$ROUTER-INFO$$

$$ROUTER-OPTIONS-HELP$$
<b>Quick Start</b>
<br>
Click on marker icons (above) to place them on the map (right).  Then
drag them to the correct position.  Zooming the map before placing the
markers is probably easiest.  Alternatively type the latitude and
longitude into the boxes above.
<p>
Select the transport type, allowed highway types, speed limits, highway
properties and other restrictions from the options above.
Select "Shortest" or "Quickest" to calculate the route and display it
on the map.
<p>
<b>Waypoints</b>
<br>
Clicking on the marker icons will toggle the display of them on the map.
When a route is calculated it will visit (as close as possible
for the selected transport type) each of the waypoints that have
markers on the map in the order given.
<p>
<b>Transport Type</b>
<br>
Selecting a transport type will restrict the chosen route to
those on which it is allowed and set default values for the
other parameters.
<p>
<b>Highway Preferences</b>
<br>
The highway preference is selected as a percentage and routes are chosen that
try to follow the preferred highways.
For example if a "Primary" road is given a "110%" preference and a "Secondary"
road is given a "100%" preference then it means that a route on a Primary road
can be up to 10% longer than on a secondary road and still be selected.
<p>
<b>Speed Limits</b>
<br>
The speed limits chosen here for the different types of highway apply if the
highway has no other speed limit marked or it is higher than the chosen one.
<p>
<b>Property Preferences</b>
<br>
The property preference is selected as a percentage and routes are chosen that
try to follow highways with the preferred property.
For example if a "Paved" highway is given a "75%" preference then it means that
an unpaved highway is automatically given a "25%" preference so that a route on
a paved highway can be 3 times the length of an unpaved one and still be
selected.
<p>
<b>Other Restrictions</b>
<br>
These allow a route to be found that avoids marked limits on
weight, height, width or length.  It is also possible to ignore
one-way restrictions (e.g. if walking).
$$ROUTER-OPTIONS-HELP$$

$$ROUTER-RESULTS-HELP$$
<b>Quick Start</b>
<br>
After calculating a route you can download the GPX file or plain
text route description (summary or detailed version). Also you
can view the route description and zoom in to selected parts.
<p>
<b>Problem Solving</b>
<br>
If the router completes with an error then the most likely cause is
that it is not possible to find a route between the selected points.
Moving one or more markers or changing the routing options should
allow a route to be found.
<p>
<b>Output Formats</b>
<br>
<dl>
  <dt>HTML instructions
  <dd>A description of the route to take with directions at each
    important junction.
  <dt>GPX track file
  <dd>The same information that is displayed on the map with points
    for every node and lines for every segment.
  <dt>GPX route file
  <dd>The same information that is displayed in text for the route
    with a waypoint for each important junction in the route.
  <dt>Full text file
  <dd>A list of all of the nodes visited as well as the distance
    between them and the cumulative distance for each step of the
    route.
  <dt>Text file
  <dd>The same information that is displayed in text for the route.

$$ROUTER-VISUALISER-INFO$$
To see Routino's view of the data there is a data visualiser that allows
displaying of the underlying data in various ways.
$$ROUTER-VISUALISER-INFO$$

# Multi-line descriptive translations (visualiser)

$$VISUALISER-INFO$$
This web page allows visualisation of the data that Routino uses for routing.
Only data relevant for routing is displayed and some will therefore be excluded.
$$VISUALISER-INFO$$

$$VISUALISER-INSTRUCTIONS$$
Zoom in and then use the buttons below to download the data.  The
server will only return data if the selected area is small enough.
$$VISUALISER-INSTRUCTIONS$$

$$VISUALISER-HELP$$
<b>Quick Start</b>
<br>
Zoom to an area and select one of the buttons to display that type of
data.
<br>
More data options can be found by expanding the details below each
button.
<p>
<b>Data Failure</b>
<br>
If the area selected is too large (depends on the data type) then the
status will say "Failed to get visualiser data" - zoom in and try
again.
