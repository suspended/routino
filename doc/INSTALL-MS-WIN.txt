                   Routino : Installation on MS Windows
                   ====================================


Using Cygwin
------------

   Cygwin is a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide
   functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows. A Cygwin DLL
   provides substantial POSIX API functionality therefore providing direct
   compatibility for most UNIX source code.

   Since Cygwin aims to replicate a Linux-like system on Windows it is the
   simplest method of compiling Routino. The disadvantage is that all
   programs compiled with Cygwin require a number of runtime Cygwin
   libraries which may introduce a runtime speed penalty.

   The installer for Cygwin can be downloaded from http://cygwin.org/;
   there are 32-bit and 64-bit versions available. For compiling Routino
   the Cygwin installer should be run and the following packages selected
   (any dependencies will be automatically be selected at the next step):

     * base packages
     * gcc-core (in 'Devel' menu)
     * make (in 'Devel' menu)
     * libbz2-devel (in 'Libs' menu)
     * zlib-devel (in 'Libs' menu)
     * perl (in 'Perl' menu)

   To compile Routino open the "Cygwin Terminal" change to the Routino
   source directory and compile using the make command.


Native Compilation
------------------

   Routino has limited support in the source code for compiling on
   Microsoft Windows. This includes a set of functions that can replace
   the mmap() and munmap() UNIX functions which are not available on
   Microsoft Windows.

   The source code should be downloaded, either as a release version file
   or from subversion - no instructions are provided for this step. The
   release versions include some files (mainly the web icons) which are
   not included in the subversion source (and which may be difficult to
   create on Windows).

Using Microsoft Visual C
- - - - - - - - - - - -

   The Routino source code (for the router at least) has been modified so
   that it will compile with the Microsoft Visual C compiler.

   The files that need to be compiled for the Routino router can be found
   from the Makefile in the 'src' directory listed in the 'ROUTER_OBJ'
   variable.

   To compile the router in slim mode the pre-processor definition 'SLIM=0'
   must be set and for non-slim mode 'SLIM=1' must be set.

   The default directory for the Routino data files must be set in the
   'ROUTINO_DATADIR' pre-processor variable. If the router command line
   '--data' option is going to be used then this variable can be set to
   any value.

   Since Microsoft Visual C does not fully support the C99 standard it is
   necessary to tell the compiler how to handle the inline functions. This
   can be done by passing in the command line option '-Dinline=__inline' to
   the C compiler.

Using MinGW
- - - - - -

   MinGW is the "Minimalist GNU for Windows" which includes some of the
   common GNU programs; principally gcc and related programs for software
   development.

   The installer for MinGW can be downloaded from 'http://mingw.org/'. For
   compiling Routino the MinGW installer should be run and the following
   packages selected:
     * mingw-base
     * msys-base
     * mingw32-pthreads-w32
     * mingw32-libz (dev package)
     * msys-perl

   To compile Routino open a DOS command window and set the path to the
   installed MinGW and MSYS software. For example if MinGW was installed
   in the 'C:/MinGW' directory then the path needs to be set to
   'C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\bin'.

   From within this DOS command window change to the Routino source
   directory and compile using the MinGW version of make with this command
   'mingw32-make MINGW=1'.

Using MinGW-W64
- - - - - - - -

   MinGW-w64 is an alernative implementation of the same concept as MinGW
   but allows for compilation to 32-bit or 64-bit executables.

   The website for MinGW-w64 is 'http://mingw-w64.org/' but the downloads
   are available from 'http://win-builds.org/'.

   The compilation method for MinGW-w64 should be the same as for MinGW.

Limitations
- - - - - -

   A native Microsoft Windows compilation of Routino is more complicated
   than compiling on Linux, other UNIX system or Cygwin. This is probably
   not an option if you are unfamiliar with software development on
   Microsoft Windows.

   The size of files that can be accessed with an MSVC or MinGW compiled
   version of Routino is limited to 32-bits (about 2 GB). The MinGW-w64
   compiler on 64-bit windows might be able to handle larger files but has
   not been tested.

   The Windows operating system does not have a function equivalent to the
   'fork()' function on UNIX. This means that it is not possible to use the
   planetsplitter program's built-in file decompression with an MSVC or
   MinGW compiled version of Routino.


Example Web Pages
-----------------

   No instructions are available for using the Routino example web pages
   with the Microsoft Web server (IIS).

   For information on setting up Apache see the "Example Web Pages"
   section of the main installation instructions.
