                           Routino : Configuration
                           =======================


   New in version 1.4 of Routino are the use of configuration files to
   allow more information to be provided to the programs at run-time. The
   configuration files that are used are:
     * Tagging transformation rules for the planetsplitter program.
     * Routing profiles for the router program.
     * Output translations for the router program.

   In keeping with the nature of the input and output files the
   configuration files are also XML files. Each of the files uses a custom
   defined XML schema and an XSD file is provided for each of them.


Tag Transformation Rules
------------------------

   The default name of the tagging transformation rules XML configuration
   file is tagging.xml in the same directory as the generated database
   files. Other filenames can be specified on the command line using the
   --tagging option. When processing the input it is possible to have a
   different set of tagging rules for each file; for example different
   rules for different countries.

   The tagging rules allow modifying the highway tags in the source file
   so that the routing can be performed on a simpler set of tags. This
   removes the special case tagging rules from the source code into the
   configuration file where they can be easily modified.

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<routino-tagging xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="routino-tagging.xsd">

</routino-tagging>


Routing Profiles
----------------

   The default name of the routing profiles XML configuration file is
   profiles.xml in the same directory as the database files. Other
   filenames can be specified on the command line using the --tagging
   option.

   The purpose of this configuration file is to allow easy modification of
   the routing parameters so that they do not all need to be specified on
   the command line. In versions of Routino before version 1.4 the default
   routing parameters (preferred highways, preferred speeds etc) were
   contained in the source code, now they are in a configuration file.
   When calculating a route the --profile option selects the named profile
   from the configuration file.

   Part of the provided profiles.xml file showing the parameters for
   transport on foot is shown below:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8" ?>
<routino-profiles xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="routino-profiles.xsd">
  <profile name="foot" transport="foot">

      <speed highway="cycleway"      kph="4" />
      <speed highway="path"          kph="4" />
      <speed highway="steps"         kph="4" />
    </speeds>

      <length limit="0.0" />
    </restrictions>
  </profile>
  <profile name="horse" transport="horse">
...
  </profile>
...
</routino-profiles>


Output Translations
-------------------

   The default name of the output translations XML configuration file is
   translations.xml in the same directory as the database files. Other
   filenames can be specified on the command line using the --translations
   option.

   The generated HTML and GPX output files (described in the next section)
   are created using the fragments of text that are defined in this file.
   Additional languages can be added to the file and are selected using
   the --language option to the router. If no language is specified the
   first one in the file is used.

   Part of the provided translations.xml file showing some of the English
   language (en) translations is shown below:

<?xml version="1.0" encoding="utf-8"?>

<routino-translations xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance" xsi:noNamespaceSchemaLocation="routino-translations.xsd">
  <language lang="en">
...
    <turn direction="-4" string="Very sharp left" />
    <turn direction="-3" string="Sharp left" />
    <turn direction="-2" string="Left" />
...
    <heading direction="-4" string="South" />
    <heading direction="-3" string="South-West" />
    <heading direction="-2" string="West" />
...
    <route type="shortest" string="Shortest" />
    <route type="quickest" string="Quickest" />

  </language>
</routino-translations>
