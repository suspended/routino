                                Program Usage
                                =============

Program Usage

   There are two programs that make up this software. The first one takes
   the planet.osm datafile from OpenStreetMap and converts it into a local
   database. The second program uses the database to determine an optimum
   route between two points.

planetsplitter

   Usage: planetsplitter
                         [--help]
                         [--dir=<name>] [--prefix=<name>]
                         [--max-iterations=<number>]
                         [--transport=<transport>]
                         [--not-highway=<highway> ...]

   --help
          Prints out the help information.

   --dir=<name>
          Sets the directory name in which to save the results. Defaults
          to the current directory.

   --prefix=<name>
          Sets the filename prefix for the files that are created.
          Defaults to no prefix.

   --max-iterations=<number>
          The maximum number of iterations to use when generating
          super-nodes and super-segments. Defaults to 10 which is normally
          enough.

   --transport=<transport>
          Allows selection of only the routes that are possible for a
          particular type of transport. Defaults to all transport types
          allowed.

   --not-highway=<highway>
          Allows particular types of highways to be ignored. Defaults to
          all highway types allowed. This option may be repeated.

   Example usage:
   bunzip2 -c great_britain.osm.bz2 | ./planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb

   This will generate the output files 'data/gb-nodes.mem',
   'data/gb-segments.mem' and 'data/gb-ways.mem'.

router

   Usage: router [--lon1=]<start-lon>  [--lat1=]<start-lat>
                 [--lon2=]<finish-lon> [--lon2=]<finish-lat>
                 [--help | --help-profile | --help-profile-js | --help-profile-pl]
                 [--dir=<name>] [--prefix=<name>]
                 [--shortest | --quickest]
                 [--all | --super]
                 [--no-output] [--quiet]
                 [--transport=<transport>]
                 [--highway-<highway>=[0|1] ...]
                 [--speed-<highway>=<speed> ...]
                 [--oneway=[0|1]]
                 [--weight=<weight>]
                 [--height=<height>] [--width=<width>] [--length=<length>]

   --lon1=<start-lon>, --lat1=<start-lat>
          The location of the starting point. If the --lon1 and --lat1
          prefixes are not used then these must be the first and second
          options.

   --lon2=<finish-lon>, --lat2=<finish-lat>
          The location of the finishing point. If the --lon2 and --lat2
          prefixes are not used then these must be the third and fourth
          options.

   --help
          Prints out the help information.

   --help-profile
          Prints out the selected transport profile (type, speed limits,
          highway preferences etc.)

   --help-profile-js
          Prints out all the compiled-in profiles as a set of Javascript
          arrays for use in the interactive webpage.

   --help-profile-pl
          Prints out all the compiled-in profiles as a set of Perl arrays
          for use in the router CGI.

   --dir=<name>
          Sets the directory name in which to save the results. Defaults
          to the current directory.

   --prefix=<name>
          Sets the filename prefix for the files that are created.
          Defaults to no prefix.

   --shortest
          Find the shortest route.

   --quickest
          Find the quickest route.

   --all
          Find the route using all nodes and segments, not using
          super-nodes and super-segments (useful for debugging only).

   --super
          Find the route using only super-nodes and super-segments, not
          using normal nodes and segments (useful for debugging only).

   --no-output
          Don't generate any output files (useful for debugging).

   --quiet
          Don't generate any screen output while running (useful for
          running in a script).

   --transport=<transport>
          Select the type of transport to use. Defaults to 'Motorcar',
          this option also selects the default profile.

   --highway-<highway>=[0|1]
          Selects the preference for using each particular type of
          highway. Default value depends on the profile selected by the
          --transport option.

   --speed-<highway>=<speed>
          Selects the speed limit for each type of highway. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --oneway=[0|1]
          Selects if the direction of oneway streets are to be obeyed
          (useful to not obey them when walking). Default value depends on
          the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --weight=<weight>
          Specifies the weight of the mode of transport, ensures that the
          weight limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --height=<height>
          Specifies the height of the mode of transport, ensures that the
          height limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --width=<width>
          Specifies the width of the mode of transport, ensures that the
          width limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --length=<length>
          Specifies the length of the mode of transport, ensures that the
          length limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   Example usage (motorbike journey, scenic route, not very fast):
   ./router --dir=data --prefix=gb --transport=motorbike --highway-motorway=0 \
            --highway-trunk=0 --speed-primary=80 --speed-secondary=80 --quickest

   This will use the files 'data/gb-nodes.mem', 'data/gb-segments.mem' and
   'data/gb-ways.mem' to find the quickest route by motorbike not using
   motorways or trunk roads and not exceeding 80 km/hr.

Common Parameters

   There are a number of parameters that are used by both programs or are used
   to specify a quantity or choice.  These are defined below.

   <transport> can be set to:
     * foot = Foot
     * bicycle = Bicycle
     * horse = Horse
     * motorbike = Motorbike
     * motorcar = Motorcar
     * goods = Goods (Small lorry, van)
     * hgv = HGV (Heavy Goods Vehicle - large lorry)
     * psv = PSV (Public Service Vehicle - bus, coach)

   <highway> can be selected from:
     * motorway = Motorway
     * trunk = Trunk
     * primary = Primary
     * secondary = Secondary
     * tertiary = Tertiary
     * unclassified = Unclassified
     * residential = Residential
     * service = Service
     * track = Track
     * path = Path
     * bridleway = Bridleway
     * cycleway = Cycleway
     * footway = Footway

   <speed> is a speed in km/hour.

   <weight> is a weight in tonnes.

   <height>, <width>, <length> are dimensions in metres.


Program Output

   There are three possible formats of output from the router program: A
   GPX track file, a text description with the junctions and a text file
   with every node.

   The output files are written to the current directory and are named
   depending on the selection of shortest or quickest route. For the
   shortest route the file names are "shortest.gpx", "shortest.txt" and
   "shortest-all.txt", for the quickest route the names are
   "quickest.gpx", "quickest.txt" and "quickest-all.txt".

GPX File

   The GPX (GPS eXchange) XML format file contains a track with all of
   the individual nodes that the route passes through.

   An example GPX file output is below:

   <?xml version="1.0" encoding="UTF-8"?>
   <gpx version="1.0" creator="Routino"
           xmlns:xsi="http://www.w3.org/2001/XMLSchema-instance"
           xmlns="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0"
           xsi:schemaLocation="http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0 http://www.topografix.com/GPX/1/0/gpx.xsd">
   <trk>
   <trkseg>
   <trkpt lat="51.524676" lon="-0.127896"/>
   <trkpt lat="51.523829" lon="-0.126993"/>
   ...
   <trkpt lat="51.478354" lon="-0.103561"/>
   <trkpt lat="51.478244" lon="-0.103652"/>
   </trkseg>
   </trk>
   </gpx>

   There are several programs that can interpret GPX files and the format
   is easy to interpret if just the latitude and longitude values are
   required.

Text File

   The text file format contains one entry for all of the junctions in the
   route and is intended to be easy to interpret.

   An example Text file output is below:

   #Latitude  Longitude  Segment   Segment    Total     Total   Highway
   #                     Distance  Duration   Distance  Durat'n
    51.5247     -0.1279  0.000 km    0.0 min    0.0 km   0 min
    51.5238     -0.1270  0.113 km    0.1 min    0.1 km   0 min  Woburn Place
    51.5227     -0.1257  0.153 km    0.2 min    0.3 km   0 min  Russell Square
    51.5209     -0.1233  0.261 km    0.3 min    0.5 km   1 min  Southampton Row
    51.5171     -0.1201  0.482 km    0.6 min    1.0 km   1 min  Kingsway
    51.5133     -0.1167  0.525 km    0.7 min    1.5 km   2 min  Aldwych

   The text file output contains a header (indicated by the lines starting
   with '#' and then one line for each junction. For each of the lines the
   latitude and longitude are the first two items. The length of the
   segment in km and the journey duration for the segment in minutes are
   the next two items. The cumulative journey distance and duration are
   the 6th and 7th items and the final item is the name of the highway.
   The individual items are separated by tabs but some of the items
   contain spaces as well.

All Nodes Text File

   The all nodes text file format contains one entry for all of the nodes
   on the route.

   An example all nodes text file output is below:

   #Latitude  Longitude     Node   Segment  Segment  Total  Total   Speed  Highway
   #                               Dist     Durat'n  Dist   Durat'n
    51.5247     -0.1279  4830582*  0.000     0.00     0.00    0.0
    51.5238     -0.1270  4830562*  0.113     0.14     0.11    0.1     96   Woburn Place
    51.5228     -0.1259  4831566*  0.138     0.17     0.25    0.3     96   Woburn Place
    51.5227     -0.1257  4836497*  0.015     0.02     0.27    0.3     96   Russell Square
    51.5221     -0.1250  4830548*  0.081     0.10     0.35    0.4     96   Russell Square

   The nodes text file output is similar to the text file output except
   that a line is printed for each of the nodes rather than just the
   junctions. The additional information on each line is the node number
   (not the OpenStreetMap node number but an internal value) as well as an
   indicator for the super-nodes and the speed for the segment.
