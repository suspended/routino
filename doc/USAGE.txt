                                Program Usage
                                =============

Routing Usage

   There are two programs that make up this software. The first one takes
   the planet.osm datafile from OpenStreetMap and converts it into a local
   database. The second program uses the database to determine an optimum
   route between two points.

planetsplitter

   Usage: planetsplitter
                         [--help]
                         [--dir=<name>] [--prefix=<name>]
                         [--max-iterations=<number>]
                         [--transport=<transport>]
                         [--not-highway=<highway> ...]

   --help
          Prints out the help information.

   --dir=<name>
          Sets the directory name in which to save the results. Defaults
          to the current directory.

   --prefix=<name>
          Sets the filename prefix for the files that are created.
          Defaults to no prefix.

   --max-iterations=<number>
          The maximum number of iterations to use when generating
          super-nodes and super-segments. Defaults to 10 which is normally
          enough.

   --transport=<transport>
          Allows selection of only the routes that are possible for a
          particular type of transport. Defaults to all transport types
          allowed.

   --not-highway=<highway>
          Allows particular types of highways to be ignored. Defaults to
          all highway types allowed. This option may be repeated.

   Example usage:
   bunzip2 -c great_britain.osm.bz2 | ./planetsplitter --dir=data --prefix=gb

   This will generate the output files 'data/gb-nodes.mem',
   'data/gb-segments.mem' and 'data/gb-ways.mem'.

router

   Usage: router [--lon1=]<start-lon>  [--lat1=]<start-lat>
                 [--lon2=]<finish-lon> [--lon2=]<finish-lat>
                 [--help | --help-profile | --help-profile-js | --help-profile-pl]
                 [--dir=<name>] [--prefix=<name>]
                 [--shortest | --quickest]
                 [--all | --super]
                 [--no-output] [--quiet]
                 [--transport=<transport>]
                 [--highway-<highway>=[0|1] ...]
                 [--speed-<highway>=<speed> ...]
                 [--oneway=[0|1]]
                 [--weight=<weight>]
                 [--height=<height>] [--width=<width>] [--length=<length>]

   --lon1=<start-lon>, --lat1=<start-lat>
          The location of the starting point. If the --lon1 and --lat1
          prefixes are not used then these must be the first and second
          options.

   --lon2=<finish-lon>, --lat2=<finish-lat>
          The location of the finishing point. If the --lon2 and --lat2
          prefixes are not used then these must be the third and fourth
          options.

   --help
          Prints out the help information.

   --help-profile
          Prints out the selected transport profile (type, speed limits,
          highway preferences etc.)

   --help-profile-js
          Prints out all the compiled-in profiles as a set of Javascript
          arrays for use in the interactive webpage.

   --help-profile-pl
          Prints out all the compiled-in profiles as a set of Perl arrays
          for use in the router CGI.

   --dir=<name>
          Sets the directory name in which to save the results. Defaults
          to the current directory.

   --prefix=<name>
          Sets the filename prefix for the files that are created.
          Defaults to no prefix.

   --shortest
          Find the shortest route.

   --quickest
          Find the quickest route.

   --all
          Find the route using all nodes and segments, not using
          super-nodes and super-segments (useful for debugging only).

   --super
          Find the route using only super-nodes and super-segments, not
          using normal nodes and segments (useful for debugging only).

   --no-output
          Don't generate any output files (useful for debugging).

   --quiet
          Don't generate any screen output while running (useful for
          running in a script).

   --transport=<transport>
          Select the type of transport to use. Defaults to 'Motorcar',
          this option also selects the default profile.

   --highway-<highway>=[0|1]
          Selects the preference for using each particular type of
          highway. Default value depends on the profile selected by the
          --transport option.

   --speed-<highway>=<speed>
          Selects the speed limit for each type of highway. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --oneway=[0|1]
          Selects if the direction of oneway streets are to be obeyed
          (useful to not obey them when walking). Default value depends on
          the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --weight=<weight>
          Specifies the weight of the mode of transport, ensures that the
          weight limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --height=<height>
          Specifies the height of the mode of transport, ensures that the
          height limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --width=<width>
          Specifies the width of the mode of transport, ensures that the
          width limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   --length=<length>
          Specifies the length of the mode of transport, ensures that the
          length limit on the highway is not exceeded. Default value
          depends on the profile selected by the --transport option.

   Example usage (motorbike journey, scenic route, not very fast):
   ./router --dir=data --prefix=gb --transport=motorbike --highway-motorway=0 \
            --highway-trunk=0 --speed-primary=80 --speed-secondary=80 --quickest

   This will use the files 'data/gb-nodes.mem', 'data/gb-segments.mem' and
   'data/gb-ways.mem' to find the quickest route by motorbike not using
   motorways or trunk roads and not exceeding 80 km/hr.
