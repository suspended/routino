<h2><a name="H_1_1"></a>Algorithms</h2>

This page describes the development of the algorithm that is used in the
software demonstrated here.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_1"></a>Simplest Algorithm</h3>

The algorithm to find a route is fundamentally simple: Start at the beginning,
follow all possible routes and keep going until you reach the end.
<p>
While this method does work, it isn't fast.  To be able to find a route quickly
needs a different algorithm, one that can find the correct answer without
wasting time on routes that lead nowhere.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_2"></a>Improved Algorithm</h3>

The simplest way to do this is to follow all possible segments from the starting
node to the next nearest node (an intermediate node in the complete journey).
For each node that is reached store the shortest route from the starting node
and the length of that route.  The list of intermediate nodes needs to be
maintained in order of shortest overall route on the assumption that there is a
straight line route from here to the end node.
<br>
At each point the intermediate node that has the shortest potential overall
journey time is processed before any other node.  From the first node in the
list follow all possible segments and place the newly discovered nodes into the
same list ordered in the same way.  This will tend to constrain the list of
nodes examined to be the ones that are between the start and end nodes.  If at
any point you reach a node that has already been reached by a longer route then
you can discard that route since the newly discovered route is shorter.
Conversely if the previously discovered route is shorter then discard the new
route.
<br>
At some point the end node will be reached and then any routes with potential
lengths longer than this actual route can be immediately discarded.  The few
remaining potential routes must be continued until they are found to be shorter
or have no possibility of being shorter.  The shortest possible route is then
found.
<p>
At all times when looking at a node only those segments that are possible by the
chosen means of transport are followed.  This allows the type of transport to be
handled easily.  When finding the quickest route the same rules apply except
that criterion for sorting is the shortest potential route (assuming that from
each node to the end is the fastest possible type of highway).
<p>
This method also works, but again it isn't very fast.  The problem is that the
complexity is proportional to the number of nodes or segments in all routes
examined between the start and end nodes.  Maintaining the list of intermediate
nodes in order is the most complex part.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_3"></a>Final Algorithm</h3>

The final algorithm that is implemented in the router is basically the one above
but with an important difference.  Instead of finding a long route among a data
set of 5,000,000 nodes (number of highway nodes in UK at beginning of 2009) it
finds one long route in a data set of 500,000 nodes and a few hundred very short
routes in the full data set.  Since the time taken to find a route is
proportional to the number of nodes the main route takes 1/10th of the time and
the very short routes take almost no time at all.
<p>
The solution to making the algorithm fast is therefore to discard most of the
nodes and only keep the interesting ones.  In this case a node is deemed to be
interesting if it is the junction of three or more segments or the junction of
two segments with different properties.  In the algorithm these are classed as
<em>super-nodes</em>.  Between each super-node and a neighbouring super-node a
<em>super-segment</em> is generated that contains the shortest path along
segments with identical properties.  This decision making process can be
repeated until the only the most important and interesting nodes remain.
<p>

<img alt="Iteration 3" src="images/example3.png"><br>
<img alt="Iteration 4" src="images/example4.png"><br>
<p>
To find a route now comprises finding a route along super-segments between the
start node and the end node followed by finding a route between each adjacent
pair of super-nodes in that route.  (The routes between the start and end nodes
and all adjacent super-nodes need to be found before the route using only
super-nodes can be found.)  This is considerably quicker than using all nodes but
gives a result that still contains the full list of nodes that are visited.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_4"></a>Implementation</h3>

The hardest part of implementing this router is the data organisation.  The
arrangement of the data to minimise the number of operations required to follow
a route from one node to another is much harder than designing the algorithm
itself.
<p>
The final implementation uses a separate table for nodes, segments and ways.
Each table individually is implemented as a C-language data structure that is
written to disk by a program which parses the OpenStreetMap XML data file.  In
the router these data structures are memory mapped so that the operating system
handles the problems of loading the needed data blocks from disk.
<p>
Each node contains a latitude and longitude and they are sorted geographically
so that converting a latitude and longitude coordinate to a node is fast as well
as looking up the coordinate of a node.  The node also contains the location in
the array of segments for the first segment that uses that node.
<br>
Each segment contains the location of the two nodes as well as the way that the
segment came from.  The location of the next segment that uses one of the two
nodes is also stored; the next segment for the other node is the following one
in the array.  The length of the segment is also pre-computed and stored.
<br>
Each way has a name, a highway type, a list of allowed types of traffic, a speed
limit and any weight, height, width or length restrictions.
<p>
The super-nodes are mixed in with the nodes and the super-segments are mixed in
with the segments.  For the nodes they are the same as the normal nodes, so just
a flag is needed to indicate that they are super.  The super-segments are in
addition to the normal segments so they increase the database size (by about
10%) and are also marked with a flag.

<h3><a name="H_1_1_5"></a>Practicalities</h3>

At the time of writing (April 2010) the OpenStreetMap data for Great Britain
(taken from
<a class="ext" href="http://download.geofabrik.de/osm/europe/" title="GeoFabrik Mirror of OpenStreetMap Data">GeoFabrik</a>
) contains:
<ul>
  <li>14,675,098 nodes
  <ul>
    <li>8,767,521 are highway nodes
    <li>1,120,297 are super-nodes
  </ul>
  <li>1,876,822 ways
  <ul>
    <li>1,412,898 are highways
    <ul>
      <li>9,316,328 highway segments
      <li>1,641,009 are super-segments
    </ul>
  </ul>
  <li>60,572 relations
</ul>

The database files when generated are 41.5 MB for nodes, 121.6 MB for segments
and 12.6 MB for ways and are stored uncompressed.  By having at least 200 MB or
RAM available the routing can be performed with no disk accesses (once the data
has been read once).
