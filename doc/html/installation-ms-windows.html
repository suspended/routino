<h2 id="H_1_1">Using Cygwin</h2>

Cygwin is a large collection of GNU and Open Source tools which provide
functionality similar to a Linux distribution on Windows.  A Cygwin DLL
provides substantial POSIX API functionality therefore providing direct
compatibility for most UNIX source code.

<p>

Since Cygwin aims to replicate a Linux-like system on Windows it is the simplest
method of compiling Routino.  The disadvantage is that all programs compiled
with Cygwin require a number of runtime Cygwin libraries which may introduce a
runtime speed penalty.

<p>

The installer for Cygwin can be downloaded from <tt>http://cygwin.org/</tt>;
there are 32-bit and 64-bit versions available.  For compiling Routino the
Cygwin installer should be run and the following packages selected (any
dependencies will be automatically be selected at the next step):

<ul>
  <li><i>base packages</i>
  <li>gcc-core (in 'Devel' menu)
  <li>make (in 'Devel' menu)
  <li>libbz2-devel (in 'Libs' menu)
  <li>zlib-devel (in 'Libs' menu)
  <li>perl (in 'Perl' menu)
</ul>

<p>

To compile Routino open the "Cygwin Terminal" change to the Routino source
directory and compile using the <tt>make</tt> command.

<p>

The programs that are compiled <tt>planetsplitter</tt>, <tt>router</tt> will
require the Cygwin runtime to be able to run them.  The
library <tt>libroutino.so</tt> should be usable with other Cygwin compiled
programs.


<h2 id="H_1_2">Native Compilation</h2>

Routino has limited support in the source code for compiling on Microsoft
Windows.  This includes a set of functions that can replace the <tt>mmap()</tt>
and <tt>munmap()</tt> UNIX functions which are not available on Microsoft
Windows.

<p>

The source code should be downloaded, either as a release version file or from
subversion - no instructions are provided for this step.  The release versions
include some files (mainly the web icons) which are not included in the
subversion source (and which may be difficult to create on Windows).


<h3 id="H_1_2_1">Using Microsoft Visual C</h3>

The Routino source code (for the router at least) has been modified so that it
will compile with the Microsoft Visual C compiler.

<p>

Compiling Routino with MSVC is not supported directly since there is only
support for using <tt>Makefile</tt>s in Routino.  The files that need to be
compiled for the Routino router can be found from the Makefile in
the <tt>src</tt> directory listed in the <tt>ROUTER_OBJ</tt> variable.

<p>

To compile the router in slim mode the pre-processor definition <tt>SLIM=0</tt>
must be set and for non-slim mode <tt>SLIM=1</tt> must be set.

<p>

The default directory for the Routino data files must be set in the
<tt>ROUTINO_DATADIR</tt> pre-processor variable.  If the router command line
<tt>--data</tt> option is going to be used then this variable can be set to any
value.

<p>

Since Microsoft Visual C does not fully support the C99 standard it is necessary
to tell the compiler how to handle the <tt>inline</tt> functions.  This can be
done by passing in the command line option <tt>-Dinline=__inline</tt> to the C
compiler.


<h3 id="H_1_2_2">Using MinGW</h3>

MinGW is the "Minimalist GNU for Windows" which includes some of the common GNU
programs; principally gcc and related programs for software development.

<p>

The installer for MinGW can be downloaded from <tt>http://mingw.org/</tt>.  For
compiling Routino the MinGW installer should be run and the following packages
selected:

<ul>
  <li>mingw-base
  <li>msys-base
  <li>mingw32-pthreads-w32
  <li>mingw32-libz (dev package)
  <li>msys-perl
</ul>

<p>

To compile Routino open a DOS command window and set the path to the installed
MinGW and MSYS software.  For example if MinGW was installed in the
<tt>C:/MinGW</tt> directory then the path needs to be set to
<tt>C:\MinGW\bin;C:\MinGW\MSYS\1.0\bin</tt>.

<p>

From within this DOS command window change to the Routino source directory and
compile using the MinGW version of <tt>make</tt> with this command
<tt>mingw32-make</tt>.

<p>

After compiling Routino a set of library files are created (<tt>routino.dll</tt>,
<tt>routino.def</tt> and <tt>routino.lib</tt>).  These should be usable for
linking with programs compiled with MSVC.


<h3 id="H_1_2_3">Using MinGW-W64</h3>

MinGW-w64 is an alernative implementation of the same concept as MinGW but
allows for compilation to 32-bit or 64-bit executables.

<p>

The website for MinGW-w64 is <tt>http://mingw-w64.org/</tt> but the downloads
are available from <tt>http://win-builds.org/</tt>.  Installation of MinGW-w64
is slightly different from that for MinGW but a similar set of packages will be
required.

<p>

The compilation method for MinGW-w64 is the same as for MinGW and the same files
will be compiled, the only difference is that by default a 64-bit version will
be created.


<h3 id="H_1_2_4">Limitations</h3>

A native Microsoft Windows compilation of Routino is more complicated than
compiling on Linux, other UNIX system or Cygwin.  This is probably not an option
if you are unfamiliar with software development on Microsoft Windows.

<p>

The size of files that can be accessed with an MSVC or MinGW (32-bit) compiled
version of Routino is limited to 32-bits (less than 4 GB).  The MinGW-w64
compiler on 64-bit is able to handle larger files (bigger than 4 GB).

<p>

The Windows operating system does not have a function equivalent to the
<tt>fork()</tt> function on UNIX.  This means that it is not possible to use
the <tt>planetsplitter</tt> program's built-in file decompression with an MSVC
or MinGW compiled version of Routino.


<h2 id="H_1_3">Example Web Pages</h2>

No instructions are available for using the Routino example web pages with the
Microsoft Web server (IIS).

<p>

For information on setting up Apache see the "Example Web Pages" section of the
main <a href="installation.html" title="Installation">installation instructions</a>.
