<h2 id="H_1_1">Data</h2>

A good router relies on good data and the
<a class="ext" title="OpenStreetMap" href="http://www.openstreetmap.org/">OpenStreetMap</a>
data is a good source.  There are however a number of things that need to be
considered about
<a href="data.html" title="Data considerations">the data used</a>.


<h2 id="H_1_2">Tagging</h2>

In addition to the raw data the way that are tags are used is also important.
With Routino the
<a title="Tagging" href="tagging.html">tagging rules</a>
are contained in a configuration file and can easily be customised to change the
interpretation of each tag.


<h2 id="H_1_3">Program Usage</h2>

There are four programs that make up this software, two create the routing
database and use the information in it and the other two perform additional functions.
<a href="usage.html" title="Program Usage">Full instructions</a>
for using the four programs are provided.


<h2 id="H_1_4">Configuration Files</h2>

When the programs are run they read in one or more
<a href="configuration.html" title="Configuration Files">configuration files</a>.
These files contain information about the routing preferences (types of highways,
preferred speeds etc), tagging rules and translation information for the outputs.


<h2 id="H_1_5">Output Files</h2>

The final result of running the router is one or more
<a href="output.html" title="Output Files">output files</a>
that contain the calculated route.


<h2 id="H_1_6">Numerical Limits</h2>

When processing data there are 
<a href="limits.html" title="Numerical Limits">numerical limits</a> for the
range of data identifiers that can be handled and the size of the database.


<h2 id="H_1_7">Algorithm</h2>

The <a title="Algorithm" href="algorithm.html">algorithm</a> that is used by
Routino takes the OpenStreetMap data and creates a local database of the
important information for rapid routing.


<h2 id="H_1_8">Installation</h2>

The Routino source code comes with a set of files that can be used to create
a working server very easily.  The full information about
<a href="installation.html" title="Installation">installation</a> describes how
to compile the programs and install them on UNIX-like systems such as Linux.

<p>

Routino can also be compiled and used on Microsoft Windows systems (with some
limitations).  There are specific
<a href="installation-ms-windows.html" title="MS Windows Installation">MS Windows installation</a>
instructions describing how to compile the programs.


<h2 id="H_1_9">Library</h2>

The Routino routing algorithm is also available as a
<a href="library.html" title="Library">shared library</a>
that can be linked with other programs to allow routing from within them.
