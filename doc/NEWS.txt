Version 1.3 of Routino released : Thu Jan 21 2010
-------------------------------------------------

Bug fixes:
  Ensure output even if the distance between two adjacent route points is small.
  Correct the determination of waypoints for abbreviated output.
  Check the command line values for filedumper --dump options.
  Made the verbose output consistent between different places.

OSM tagging
  Recognise "designation" tag to determine designated paths.
  Recognise "steps" tag to determine the highway type.
  Recognise "wheelchair" tag to determine if wheelchairs are allowed on highway.
  Recognise "moped" tag to determine if mopeds are allowed on a highway.
  Recognise "surface" and "paved" tags to determine if a highway is paved.
  Recognise "lanes" tag to determine if a highway has multiple lanes.
  Recognise "bridge" tag to determine if a highway is a bridge.
  Recognise "tunnel" tag to determine if a highway is a tunnel.

New Features
  Remove "bridleway" and "footway" highway types and use "path" highway instead.
  Added "steps" as a new highway type separate from the "path" type.
  Added "wheelchair" and "moped" to the list of possible transports.
  Added "paved", "multilane", "bridge", "tunnel" to list of highway properties.

router
  For each waypoint choose closest point on a segment and not just closest node.
  Added the ability to set preferences based on highway properties.
  Changed the text output formats to include bearing and turn information.


Version 1.2 of Routino released : Wed Oct 21 2009
-------------------------------------------------

OSM tagging
  Recognise tags "vehicle" and "motor_vehicle".
  Handle duplicate ways in the input OSM file (e.g. concatenation of 2 files).

Database
  Identical ways are combined to reduce database size (~80% fewer ways stored).

Routing
  Fix weight, height, width, length restriction routing.
  Allow up to 99 waypoints to be specified instead of 9.

Visualiser
  Don't display speed limits for tracks and paths unless a value is set.
  Draw all super-segments that cross the selected boundary.

planetsplitter
  Optional slim mode uses minimal memory at the expense of temporary files.

router
  Less CPU time for routing (~30% less).

filedumper
  Allow dumping individual nodes, segments and ways (for debug).


Version 1.1 of Routino released : Sat Jun 13 2009
-------------------------------------------------

Inputs
  Improve parsing of OSM file (imperial units).
  Ignore nodes that are missing from the input OSM file.

Outputs
  Create GPX route files as well as GPX track files.
  Read in an optional copyright.txt file and include contents in output.
  Make better choices about what to output in the abbreviated text file.

Routing
  Allow generating a route with intermediate waypoints.
  Use preferences for highway types instead of yes/no choice.
  Choice of closest node to start/finish points ensures transport allowed.

Visualiser
  Added data extraction function for viewing routing database data.

Web Pages
  Include full set of web pages for creating customised online router.

Documentation
  Included NEWS.txt file.
  Included documentation for installation of web pages.
