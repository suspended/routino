                        Program Compilation / Installation
                        ==================================

Compilation

   This program has been written to run on Linux, no cross-platform
   compatibility has been specifically included but on the other hand nothing
   platform specific has been included.

   Any information on improving the compilation process on anything other than
   32-bit x86 Linux is welcome.

   No external libraries are required and the programs are written in standard C
   language.

   To compile the programs just type 'make'.
